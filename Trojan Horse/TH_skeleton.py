# Trojan Horse Skeleton Structure

# Step 1: Disguised Payload
def innocent_function():
    # Code that performs a harmless or desirable function
    pass

# Step 2: Entrance Point
def main():
    # Code that triggers the Trojan's execution
    innocent_function()

# Step 3: Payload Execution
def malicious_action():
    # Code that performs malicious actions
    # Example: Sending stolen data to a remote server
    send_data_to_server()

def send_data_to_server():
    # Code to establish communication with a remote server
    pass

# Step 4: Concealment
def conceal_malicious_activity():
    # Code that hides the Trojan's presence or actions
    pass

# Step 5: Communication
def communicate_with_server():
    # Code that sends or receives commands/data from a remote server
    pass

# Step 6: Persistence
def establish_persistence():
    # Code that ensures the Trojan remains active across reboots
    pass

# Step 7: Evasion Techniques
def evade_detection():
    # Code that avoids detection by security software
    pass

# Step 8: Secondary Functions
def additional_functions():
    # Code for any additional malicious functions
    pass
