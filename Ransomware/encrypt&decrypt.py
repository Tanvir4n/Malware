Explanation:
Encryption Function (encrypt_file):
• Reads the file content.
• Generates a random nonce.
• Encrypts the file content using AES in GCM mode.
• Writes the nonce, tag, and ciphertext to a new file with the .enc extension.
• Deletes the original file.

Decryption Function (decrypt_file):
• Reads the encrypted file content (nonce, tag, and ciphertext).
• Decrypts the file content using the provided key.
• Writes the original file content back to a file without the .enc extension.
• Deletes the encrypted file.

Main Function (main):
• Prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
• For decryption, it asks for a key.
• Iterates through the files in the ./home directory.
• Encrypts or decrypts the files based on the user's choice.

This Python script will handle both encryption and decryption of files in the ./home directory based on the user's choice.
